# Open Chat
Small chat server and client that use PNPM + Vite + React Typescript + Socket IO

# Disclaimer
I'm not the author of the original project which can be found [here as a tutorial](https://dev.to/novu/building-a-chat-app-with-socketio-and-react-2edj). I just wanted to test PNPM + Vite + React Typescript + Socket IO to train myself and implementing these techs with that tutorial sounded nice.

# Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lay3r8/open-chat.git
cd client && pnpm install && cd ../server && pnpm install
```

# Usage
## Server
```bash
cd server
pnpm start
```

## Client
```bash
cd client
npx vite
```
